## Introduction

Getting in the top 10% of the most competent people in your company or local area might not be as difficult as you think. Most people are unwilling to dedicate a considerable amount of time and effort to maintaining and improving their skill-set. This opens up a lot of possibilities for the ambitious and disciplined.

I will use examples from software development since it is my area of expertise.

## Learn and discover new things

A common trend I have noticed in most developers (and in other occupations) is that getting a secure job diminishes the curiosity and drive to learn new things.

Let's assume you are fairly competent in your field. There is almost certainly a considerable difference between your efforts now and when you were just starting out. Monotony and staleness also play a substantial part in this, but it seems necessary to lean into this to stand out.

Having a full-time job may mean you don't have as much time to improve your skills as you did before your employment, but investing even a small amount of time consistently can make a big difference.

## Focus on the work

How many times have you done something only to end up frantically checking your email, messages, or reading random news websites?

Several studies have shown that most people spend more time doing things unrelated to their work. This includes reading news, checking social media, texting, looking for new jobs, etc.

A study has shown that most people are productive for about 2 hours and 53 minutes on an average 8-hour workday. The top 10 distractions were:

1. Checking social media – 47%

2. Reading news websites – 45%

3. Discussing out-of-work activities with colleagues – 38%

4. Making hot drinks – 31%

5. Smoking breaks – 28%

6. Text/instant messaging – 27%

7. Eating snacks – 25%

8. Making food in the office – 24%

9. Making calls to partner/ friends- 24%

10. Job searching – 19%

By removing these distractions deliberately and working with real focus, you will find that you can get much more work done in a shorter amount of time. This kind of focused work itself is a skill you can train.
So you work less and accomplish more. The price you pay is not spending time mindlessly scrolling through various social media or random websites, seems like a win-win.

## Take on responsibility

This part seems difficult if you're in the start of your career, but don't let this mislead you. To quote the psychologist Jordan Peterson, “_Notice that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated_”.

By being a person who intentionally wants to do more and be more involved in the decision-making processes of the business you're involved in, you can not only learn a lot but become a much more valuable employee. 
As a result of taking more responsibility, you will also gain authority, since these two are closely related.

Don't sell yourself short by thinking you need some “_special_” skill to handle more responsibility. Leaning into this will help you advance more quickly and build confidence for dealing with even more things in the future.

Distinguish yourself as a person willing to take part in key decisions. A certain amount of risk is involved, but it's difficult to make significant progress without it.

## Put effort into what you do

Let's take an example from software development. Were you ever assigned an older project to improve something and got frustrated?

It's not that the people who worked on this were incapable of making it more readable and clean. Instead, the amount of thought and effort that they put into it is simply not up to standards. The files and functions are too big, variable names are clumsily named, there are obsolete comments, dead code, etc.

**By being a person who puts effort into his craft, you can get into that smaller pool of highly valuable individuals.**

So in developer terms, this kind of effort would include: ruthlessly refactoring, paying attention to variable names, using minimal amounts of comments while trying to convey the meaning through the code itself, etc. To quote a famous software engineer Grady Booch: “_Clean code reads like well-written prose..._“.

## Develop your social skills

Don't fall into the trap of thinking things like: “_I'm a computer guy therefore I don't know how to speak to people_”. Any kind of mindset that puts you into a particular "_box_" is not in any way useful and limits your capabilities.

Having effective social skills will most definitely make you more capable in almost all aspects of a particular career.

For example, your suggestions and proposed solutions will be taken into consideration. You will be better able to convey information to others, and things will get done more quickly. This is because it will be easier to agree about who does what and so on.

Another point is that you will be better able to discuss and negotiate your salary, as well as the general satisfaction with your current position.

## Conclusion

These are some of the things I have noticed throughout the last year and a half working in a large software development company. Following these principles allowed me to make progress quickly and be appreciated for the efforts I put in. I consider these points more as observations rather than advice because everyone's situation is different. I hope you will take something from this and apply it to _your_ particular case.
