> The behaviors you engage in throughout the day can have a big impact on all aspects of your life. There might be some things you are not leveraging that are simple to implement into your routine but make a big difference for your overall well-being. I'll go over some tips I have picked up and are most effective from my personal experience. These tips are grounded in scientific research.

## Why sleep is important

Getting high-quality sleep regularly can drastically improve every aspect of your life. People often think they can override their sleep needs and have more waking hours available, but this type of behavior can be very detrimental to your health and results in a loss of time in the long run.

The time you think you got from reducing your sleep is essentially making all your other waking hours less efficient and enjoyable. So the thing we need to understand is that sleep is an essential physiological need that we cannot get around.

Low-quality sleep is associated with various health-detrimental effects such as **depression**, **obesity**, **impaired immunity**, and many others.

Below are the points that seem to make the most impact on good sleep:

### Consistent sleeping schedule

A consistent sleeping schedule will make you wake up and fall asleep more easily.

This is because our body has an inner biological clock running in the background, and varying your sleep-wake cycle disrupts this clock. Your biological clock is closely related to circadian cycles. Learn more about what they are by reading into the studies mentioned at the end.

Humans are diurnal animals, which means we are set up to be awake during the day and sleep during the night. So if you're having trouble falling asleep and feel awake at late hours, chances are you're engaging in behaviors that disrupt your clock.

The primary affectors of your clock are light exposure, food, and physical activity, more about this in the following sections.

**Find a schedule that works for you and stick to it.**

### Early morning sunlight

View sunlight within an hour of waking up, or if you wake up really early, as soon as the sun comes out.

Getting outside and getting some light in your eyes will naturally wake you up. The light is essentially telling your body it's daytime, I need to be alert and do stuff. The more bright light you get during the day, the more alert you feel.

The only way your body knows if it's day and not night is through the light receptors on your eyes. Not getting enough light, especially in the early part of the day will eventually disrupt your cycle, which results in many detrimental effects.

Depending on how bright it is, you might need more or less light, but about 10 minutes seems to work well.

**Take a short 10-30 minute walk in the morning.**

### Avoid bright lights at night

Following the logic from the previous point, getting light into your eyes at night will make you more alert and disrupt your inner clock. Since the body's main mechanism for determining the time of day is through your eyes, the body will think it is daytime, and therefore you will have a hard time falling asleep.

You can see why this would be the case since throughout human history it was literally not possible to view light at night. This is why using your phone in bed or watching TV right until your bedtime can and probably will disrupt your sleep.

Light emitted by fire does not have this effect, so it could be a good idea to turn off the lights and light a few candles close to sleep.

**Don't use devices with screens at least an hour before bedtime and dim your lights, or ideally light a few candles.**

### Eating late

It is best not to eat anything a few hours before going to sleep, since digestion can negatively affect sleep quality.

If the meal was large, you are likely to have acid reflux and heartburn which will either keep you awake or worsen your sleep quality. If you find that you get hungry at a time you want to get to sleep, there's a chance you're not eating enough high-quality meals throughout your day.

If you are not nutrient deficient you should have no problems not eating for these relatively short periods.

**The ideal time for your last meal seems to be about 3 hours before bed.**

### Caffeine late in the day

Avoid caffeine late in the day. Caffeine works by blocking the adenosine receptor, which is a chemical that builds up in your brain the longer you stay awake and makes you more sleepy.
You might think caffeine does not affect you since you fall asleep just fine after a coffee in the evening, but your sleep quality is just as important, and it almost surely suffers from ingesting caffeine late in the day. These results are reproduced in every available study on caffeine and sleep.

Another tip regarding caffeine is to delay it for 90-120 minutes after waking. This is because the adenosine system on which the caffeine acts is not yet active when you first wake up. At this time your adrenal system is active and the body is naturally producing the stress hormone cortisol to make you feel more alert. If you do this, you will feel the effects of caffeine much more intensely.

**Limit your caffeine intake to the early part of the day.**

### Alcohol and other drugs

Contrary to popular belief, alcohol does not make you sleep better. It can make you fall asleep faster since it acts as a sedative, but the quality of your sleep suffers. The same goes for marijuana. Both of these significantly reduce the amount of deep and REM sleep you're getting. These are the phases of sleep where you're getting the proper recovery you need.

**Avoid drinking alcohol and using drugs to fall asleep.**

### Relax

Lastly, a thing I found especially useful is to relax as you approach your desired bedtime.
Give your body a period in which it can calm itself down, without any outside stimuli.

So, finding a relaxing activity to do approaching bedtime can be extremely beneficial. For example, most nights I read and then do some light stretching, or journal and just lie on the couch for some time. By the time I get to bed I'm feeling really sleepy because I allowed myself some time to wind down.

**Do relaxing activities as you approach your bedtime.**

### Conclusion

Paying attention to your sleep is something that got some real attention over the past couple of years. People are more aware of the health effects of sleep, and in general, there is a rapid increase of health information available to the general public. A lot of us do not give much attention to these topics or are simply not familiar with them, but they can truly make a huge impact on our overall well-being.
